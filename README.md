# CurseServerpackGenerator
 Simple console program to create a server pack from a curseforge instance

Only tried for 1.21, and supporting only neoforge for a mod loader atm
Idk if i will update it if nobody asks for it

To use it, simply put it into the instance folder of your modpack, or run it with --instanceDir <path>
